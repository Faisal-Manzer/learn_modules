## What is Kubernetes
	
	Kubernetes is a containerized deployment management tool. It helps to manage 
	containerized workloads.
	Kubernetes is written in Go

## Canary Deploments

	During the old mining times in britain the miners used to put caged canaries in 
	the mine and when ever the level of methane would increase or oxygen decreased
	beyond the safety limit the canaries would die or faint giving a signal to the 
	miners to vacate the caves
	
	Something similar is used in containerized workloads where a certain portion
	of servers are kept as canary servers and any new cahanges are first rolled out 
	on these servers and tested and then rolled out full fleged.
